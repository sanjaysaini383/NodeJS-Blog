<h1>About Page</h1>
<p> Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript
    code on the server side. Built on Chrome's V8 engine, it enables high-performance and scalable network applications.
    Its non-blocking, event-driven architecture makes it ideal for handling multiple simultaneous connections
    efficiently, which is especially useful in real-time applications like chat apps and live streaming. One of the
    biggest advantages of Node.js is that it allows developers to use JavaScript for both frontend and backend
    development, streamlining the workflow and reducing the need to switch between languages. Additionally, Node.js has
    a rich ecosystem of libraries and modules available through npm (Node Package Manager), making development faster
    and easier. Due to its speed, efficiency, and flexibility, Node.js is widely adopted by major companies like
    Netflix, PayPal, and LinkedIn, and continues to be a popular choice for building modern web applications.
